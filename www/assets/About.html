            <p>This privacy policy covers how ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> treats your personal information ("Personal Information") that ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> collects and receives on Endevr's websites ("Websites"), including information related to your past use of the Websites. Your Personal Information is information about you that may or may not be personally identifiable like your user name, password, email address, or personal profile data that is not otherwise publicly available. Your Personal Information also includes all of the information that you input onto the MyID Website or MyID App and which is also accessible via QR code reader. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> does not own or control or to people that ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> does not employ or manage. All Personal Information that is entered into the Websites by you is private to you except to the extent that you opt - against our recommendation - to share such Personal Information with other persons who may access the Websites. Other than for the reasons explicitly described below, it is the policy of ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> not to disclose Personal Information to any third party at any time.</p><p>Conversely, given that a portion of the purpose of the Websites is to share what its customers have experienced with others, our policy regarding Submissions is very different. While our objective is to safeguard your identity, privacy and anonymity, our goal is also to publicly publish and promote the Submissions that describe what you have experienced without identifying who you are so that others can recognize experiences that have been shared by people who are similar in background to themselves. Always use caution when giving out any personally identifiable information about yourself, other family members or friends in the Websites. ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> does not control or endorse the content, messages or information exchanged by means of the Websites and, therefore, ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Websites and any actions resulting from your participation in the Websites.</p><p>ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> collects Personal Information when you register with, use or visit the Website, and when you visit the pages of certain ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> partners. ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register we ask for information such as your user name, password, email address, and personal profile. Once you register with ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> and sign in to a Website you may not be completely anonymous to us. ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> may collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners. ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> may set and access cookies on your computer.</p><p>ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> may automatically receive and record Personal Information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> cookie information, and the pages you request.</p><p>ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> may use Personal Information for the following general purposes: to customize the content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide reporting for internal and external clients.</p><p>ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> does not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with third parties except to provide products or services you've previously requested, or unless we have your express permission, or under the following circumstances:</p><p>We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your Personal Information to help communicate with you about news and information related to Endevr. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.</p><p>We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Endevr's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.</p><p>We transfer information about you if ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> is acquired by or merged with another company.</p><p>California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights Under California law, our Members customers that are California residents may request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. As detailed above, we do not share our customer's personal information with unaffiliated third parties for direct marketing purposes without their approval.</p><p>If at any time you wish to opt out of having your Personal Information shared with third parties and or receiving information from ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> (via e-mail or postal mail) about new products, services, or promotions, you can do so. You may contact us by e-mailing us at info@endevr.com. Please indicate what publications or services you no longer wish to receive so that we may better address your needs.</p><p>Your Personal Information is one of our most valuable assets. It is kept physically secure in our data centers and is accessible only to authorized personnel as needed to perform operations governed by this policy. In addition, when ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> collects information from you, ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> uses Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, the industry standard for protecting privacy in web transactions. Please keep in mind that despite these measures, ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> cannot guarantee or warrant 100% security of its servers and databases. Moreover, ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> cannot guarantee that Personal Information that you submit through the Websites will not be intercepted.</p><p>ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> believes that it is especially important to protect children's privacy online. ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> does not knowingly collect or use any Personal Information from children under the age of 13 and ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> does not knowingly provide any Personal Information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from visitors younger than 13 years old. No information should be submitted to or posted at ENDEVR<sup class="sup">TM</sup> by visitors younger than 13 years old.</p><p>Any inquiries concerning this Privacy Policy should be directed to info@endevr.com.</p>
